  "bio": "Katrina Bakas is… a lot of things. She is a sister, a partner, a dog-parent, a customer experience enthusiast, and a Senior Product Manager at Pivotal, working in Research & Development within Cloud Foundry. She has experienced a breadth of work environments in her career, from a Fortune 500 Financial Services company, to a 30-person start-up, to a successful IPO, she feels lucky to have seen a lot. As she has had the chance to experience different environments, she has been relentless in recognizing those who so often go unseen. Her aim is to invite you to do the same and to empower those of us working in the shadows to take the chance to make ourselves be seen, and encouraging those with the spotlight to share the light on others.",

      "desc": "\"Kate comes across as too pushy and abrasive in front of clients. Maybe she should try to be more accommodating.\" \"Jim can really be a strong driving force when it comes to convincing clients. His confident approach shows clients we believe in what we’re doing.\" This is an all-too-common example of similar behaviour perceived and evaluated differently based on one’s gender presentation. Does this situation sound familiar? If it does, you’ve probably experienced gendered feedback - a construct that harms everyone and is never fair. In this talk we will discuss how to identify gendered feedback when it’s not so obvious, how it’s having a tangible impact on your career success and how to protect yourself from it while leveraging your peer network.",
