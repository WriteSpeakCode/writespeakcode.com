  "bio": "Katrina Bakas isâ€¦ a lot of things. She is a sister, a partner, a dog-parent, a customer experience enthusiast, and a Senior Product Manager at Pivotal, working in Research & Development within Cloud Foundry. She has experienced a breadth of work environments in her career, from a Fortune 500 Financial Services company, to a 30-person start-up, to a successful IPO, she feels lucky to have seen a lot. As she has had the chance to experience different environments, she has been relentless in recognizing those who so often go unseen. Her aim is to invite you to do the same and to empower those of us working in the shadows to take the chance to make ourselves be seen, and encouraging those with the spotlight to share the light on others.",
