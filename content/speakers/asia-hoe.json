A friend of mine created a platform called Write Together which uses a GitHub inspired streak counter to help incentivize writers on the platform to write daily. Now 136 days strong, and counting, I want to share how writing has had numerous benefits for my wellbeing, friendships, and career, and how and why you should start your own writing practice too!",
