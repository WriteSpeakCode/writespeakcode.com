Especially if you're an introvert or have a social anxiety disorder like I do. In this talk, we'll explore strategies to excel at public speaking and conquer our fears through a series of incremental steps. From vocal variation exercises to video blogging to PowerPoint parties (more fun than it sounds!), I'll share everything that helped me become a public speaker while conquering my social anxiety along the way. In psychology we call this \"systematic desensitization\". I just call it \"lots of small wins over time\"!",
