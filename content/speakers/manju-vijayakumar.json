Come learn how I gave my first tech talk gone bad, a full 45 mins (shudder!) and yet came out alive after several mistakes. I had all the ingredients of a good tech talk gone bad - Audio/Video fail, nerves, tough audience, challenging Q&A etc. And still managed to come out as one of the best talks at the tech conference per audience voting! You may know what to do at a tech talk, now learn what not to do as I walk you through each failure scenario and how I recovered from them.",
