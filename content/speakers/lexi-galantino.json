      "desc": "Online harassment and abuse is a major problem, and when users don't feel safe on a platform, they will leave. In this talk I argue that everyone who is building software for humans has the ethical responsibility to build with user trust & safety in mind. With that perspective, I walk through the framework my team uses to evaluate and develop features, and I give examples of this framework in action. I hope that attendees will come away from this talk knowing why they should and how they can bring the principles of trust & safety back to their own work."
