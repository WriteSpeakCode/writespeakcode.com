      "desc": "Toxic workplaces come in many kinds, and some are so sneaky you won’t know you were in one until you’re long gone. Abuse survival is like that sometimes. Time in the industry helps give you that baseline, but wouldn’t it be nice to identify these before you have years of trauma to get over? This talk will be going over various ways that workplaces can be toxic, the psychological safety techniques that work to survive them, and how to identify you may be adopting some of these techniques. Knowing you’re in a toxic environment helps isolate the long-term damage, and gives you a leg up in relearning healthier techniques when you get to a safer place of work.",
