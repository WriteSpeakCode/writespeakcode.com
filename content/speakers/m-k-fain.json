      "title": "Free Software as a Feminist Issue",
      "desc": "As software begins to control more and more of our lives, the Free Software movement limps along, failing to reach mainstream consciousness. Women are in a unique position to help change the future of software and help protect our liberty – But while we are still fighting to even be accepted as technologists in the first place, why should we care? This non-technical presentation will explore the adverse impact that proprietary software has on women and girls across the world, and make an argument for software freedom as a human rights and feminist issue. We will look at access to technology and technological education, direct physical harms of proprietary software on women, and the use of proprietary software to uphold the status quo: including patriarchy. Additionally, we will discuss the unique value that women can bring to the struggling FOSS movement, and the important role women have played in organizing the great social movements of the past. Attendees should leave this presentation with a new framework to understand why we need women in tech. It’s not just about diversity for diversity’s sake – it’s about creating a better world for generations of women and girls to come."
