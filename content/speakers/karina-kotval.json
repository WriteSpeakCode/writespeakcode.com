  "bio": "Hey there! My name is Karina. I’m a queer, woman-of-color working as a product designer in SF. Originally, I’m from India; where opportunities for women (queer women, especially) are extremely limited. My family moved to the US when I was 10 years old, and I’ve been working since then to make this country my home and understand my identity in the tech world. \n\nMy experience has been vast. I’m a fine artist by nature, and went to college for design on the East coast. I worked as a front-end engineer after college, but went back to my design roots once I moved to California. I’ve worked in higher education, fitness and now lead the product design team for an early education SaaS company in San Francisco. I’m looking to get more involved in the design community to share my experiences, stories and knowledge for any person looking to transition into design, people struggling with their sexual identities, or anyone who’s finding it difficult to assimilate in American culture (been there, done that). Design is a common language shared amongst many cultures & countries, and I’d love to help expand that.",
