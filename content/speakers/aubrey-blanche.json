      "desc": "The workforce of the future will look nothing like it does today. With changing demographics, increased automation, and a breakdown of traditional corporate silos, businesses which don’t adapt—and keep adapting–will be at a competitive disadvantage. In the future teams, not individuals will drive innovation, and research shows that diverse and inclusive teams maximize results. An innovative, iterative, data-informed diversity & inclusion strategy can not only help you attract the right talent but also retain it. Right now, you have the data you need to begin understanding your barriers to building a diverse workforce, and how to invest to create an inclusive culture. Over the past two years, collaboration software maker Atlassian has been able to improve its hiring of women in technical roles by 80% while simultaneously improving the representation of employees over 40 and those from underrepresented cultural groups. Join Aubrey Blanche, Atlassian’s Global Head of Diversity & Belonging, to hear how you can leverage your data to build a balanced team at scale."
