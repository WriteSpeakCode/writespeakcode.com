      "desc": "Salary transparency is a necessary precursor to salary fairness.  In advocating for salary transparency, we face three main obstacles - a concern for employee's privacy, social stigma against open talk about money issues, and desire to obscure salary inequity. This talk will discuss some approaches to communicating the importance of salary transparency as well as assuaging concerns about those issues.",
