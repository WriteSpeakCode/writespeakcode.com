From writing your first \“Hello, World!\” program, to maintaining your an unruly legacy system, and everything in between, the code we write shapes us.  This is a love letter to all the code I\’ve written, read, reviewed and (sometimes) loathed. The laughs and frustrations in this talk are shared by anyone that\’s ever had to debug a missing semicolon or thought they weren\'t good enough to do the job they were already doing.  The lessons learned are ones I\’ve taken with me everywhere I go."
