In this talk we’ll examine our reluctance to ask questions in the workplace and how the stereotype of the 10x superstar developer is driving us to second-guess and devalue ourselves as developers. We’ll explore the roles that psychological safety and debunking stereotypes have on nurturing creative and supportive spaces in tech. Come find out how asking your dumb question helps make that happen.",
