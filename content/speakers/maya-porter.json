      "desc": "Making a funny remark on your feet in front of strangers is intimidating. Luckily for us, good improv isn't about making well-timed jokes or being the funniest person in the room. For some, learning improv comedy can even reduce social anxiety. Improv for Introverts is a safe space to try out improv through supportive exercises. The lovely thing about these energizing improvised-theater activities is that everyone is expected and ENCOURAGED to have fun and make mistakes. This workshop's activities are specially crafted to focus on lifting the next person up (instead of competing with them)! By the end of the workshop, you'll feel more comfortable with ambiguity and authentically connected to others. You'll also walk away with ways to foster more welcoming environments where you work and beyond.",
