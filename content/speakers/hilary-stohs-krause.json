  "bio": "Hilary Stohs-Krause is currently based in Madison, WI, working as a full-stack software developer at Ten Forward Consulting. She came to tech by way of childhood website-building (a \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" fansite, to be exact, complete with a guestbook and visitor counter). She volunteers regularly with several tech and community organizations, and co-runs Madison Women in Tech, a local group with more than 1,800 members. She loves sci-fi/fantasy, board games and bourbon barrel-aged stouts. She tweets at @hilarysk.",
