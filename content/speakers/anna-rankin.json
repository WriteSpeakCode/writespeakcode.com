  "bio": "Currently, Anna is a Software Engineer at General Assembly, helping build tools with an aim to change the way adults learn. Before finding her true calling as a computer whisperer, she explored careers in the arts, education, and even community relations for a small island! A lover of puns, mentorship, and learning through failure, you can find her written work on dev.to/annarankin. When she’s not trying to finish one of the four books she’s reading concurrently, you can find her lurking on Twitter or creating pixel art of her dog.",
