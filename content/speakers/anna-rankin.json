  "bio": "Currently, Anna is a Software Engineer at General Assembly, helping build tools with an aim to change the way adults learn. Before finding her true calling as a computer whisperer, she explored careers in the arts, education, and even community relations for a small island! A lover of puns, mentorship, and learning through failure, you can find her written work on dev.to/annarankin. When she’s not trying to finish one of the four books she’s reading concurrently, you can find her lurking on Twitter or creating pixel art of her dog.",

      "desc": "Understanding new concepts and complex systems is hard. Explaining them? That’s even harder. Like anyone in a highly specialized career, software engineers may struggle to convey information concisely, confidently, and clearly to technical and non-technical folks. As an illustrator and former graphic designer, Anna has found that visual art can be the key to both deeper understanding and clearer, more accessible communication. In this talk, we’ll explore why the ability to clearly communicate is vital to mastering complex topics, how to choose the right abstractions to present to a specific audience, and how a different medium can provide a new lens through which to view a familiar concept.",
